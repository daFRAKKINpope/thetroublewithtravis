# Today is a beautiful day. 
It really is. I woke up and took a walk with the sunrise. It wasn't too hot, not to cold. Beautiful as the sun crept over the horizon. It ain't home. But it's somethin'. 

# This is a second test
So, as I'm sure you've figured out, this is a blog site. This is a second test. It should do the following 
- Using the .sh script make it easy for me to build a new blog post. Put everything where it needs to be, and present a blog for me with a quickref on what to use in markdown using Jekyll. 
- Add the title using the config I found. No longer should this website be titled 'your awesome title'. Should now be the trouble with travis. 
- Display the new article on the homepage.

No. I still don't have a dark mode. Which is a bummer. But I just can't figure out how to add themes yet. It's pretty high on my priority. I was able to get around it locally by updating Jekyll to a newer version, which supports dark mode on the basic theme. Buuuuut since I'm not self hosting it and putting it up on git, I can't controll which version of Jekyll they use. So... it's a problem. I'll probably get around it by learning how to use themes. But that'll probably be in seperate commits. 

Look, I know this site doesn't have a lot going on at the moment. I also cannot promise you what kinda content this site will actually host. But what I can promise you is that it'll host, something. It'll be good. Promise.

If this works I'll need to add it to the template. If not, well, shit. 
Welcome to your new post! Here are some tips and tricks for using **Markdown** and **Jekyll code snippets** effectively.

## ðŸ“Œ Code Snippets in Jekyll

Wrap your code in Liquid highlight blocks for syntax highlighting. Example:

{% raw %}
```ruby
def greet(name)
  puts "Hello, \#{name}!"
end
greet('Travis')
# => Hello, Travis!
```
{% endraw %}

For inline code, use single backticks like `this`.
