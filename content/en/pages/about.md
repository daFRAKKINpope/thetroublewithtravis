Like most things, this all started to see if I could. 

See, I'd had this idea for The Trouble with Travis a long time ago. It would be a blog space, where I'd explore (and probably fumble a bit) through some writings and just get it out there. See where it lead. But there were several problems with how I'd set it up. 

Well, not problems exactly. It was cumbersome. Wordpress was heavy for what I wanted to do. It turns out that if you put a small barrier to entry, I'm not prone to write very much on that plat form. 

So, this. This simple static site is hosted in Hugo and... in theory... It should be enough to just write in markdown, send it, and commit it to github. So, this should help flex my muscles in github, and in HTML coding to improve my skills in both. I'm quite proud of it. It's very nice, don't you think?

I see you shuffle nerviously and ask, "No, I mean... but why am I here?"

Oh, fuck if I know dude. You showed up here. Wanna sign up for my patreon?
