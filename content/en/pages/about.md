Like most things I do, this all started to see if I could. 

I'd had this idea for The Trouble with Travis a long time ago. It would be a blog space, where I'd explore (and probably fumble a bit) through some writings and just get it out there. Not to "BACK IN MY DAY" you but, back in my day the internet had more heart. It was more than just three websites taking up all the traffic. It was forums and IRC chats and blog posts. Pictures took 15min to load and written content had to be generated by hand (not ai). So I'm trying to bring that back a little bit. 

What you'll find here is ramblings and maybe some tech stuff at some point. I'm not sure really. It's just getting started. But, I'm glad you're here.
