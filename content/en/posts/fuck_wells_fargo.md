title = 'Fuck Wells Fargo'
+++
Once upon a time, I was very young.  I got a job.  That job asked me to get a bank so they could deposit their checks directly to me.  Young, independent, and so very sure of myself I walked into a Wells Fargo.  They opened a checking account for me, and everything was fine.  The job didn't last long.  I counted every penny as every penny was precious.  

So it was really weird when I checked my account and it was over drafted by $100 dollars.  $100 dollars I had no way to pay back.  Wells Fargo told me I had ten dollars.  That I'd spent seven on cigarettes.  I then spent twenty dollars at something called a 'treat center'.  Then I'd spent two dollars for delicious beverage.  I didn't have enough money for the treat center, then I didn't have enough money for the delicious beverage, so they'd charged me two overdraft fees for $35 buckos each.  Which means I'd owed them $100 dollars.  That is a lot of money for a jobless 18 year. Their story has one additional problem, I never went to a treat center.  

Now, I can already hear you.  "Oh suuuuure. The impulsive, irresponsible, young, 18 year old DIDN'T get treats."  And, I mean, yeah. Okay. That's fair.  I do love treats.  Even today.  But I swear to you.  I did *not* enter an establishment called the treat center, and I have never received a single treat in my entire life. So I did what any level headed, mature teenager would do.  

I went in person to the receptionist and asked her just what in the fuck they thought they were doing. They opened a fraud case.  They said they'd investigate the charge, and get back to me in a few weeks.  I told them to go fuck themselves and close my account.  Then I walked across the street to a credit union and have never had an issue since. 

A few weeks later Wells Fargo sent me a letter saying they removed the charges and the late fees.  But I'd already moved on from the relationship to my hotter, more sexy, credit union.  

The thing is, every time I see their commercials or their banks on the side of the road I'm filled with rage.  The implication that I recklessly went in for twenty dollars of treats when I knew I didn't have the money.  And then!  And then they had the audacity to charge me over SEVENTY DOLLARS for those twenty dollars of treats.  Even if I had overspent how the fuck are you going to charge me $70 dollars for not having $20?  Like, where do you think that money is going to come from?  

It was just then that I'd learned an important lesson:
**It's expensive to be poor.**  

I'd learned another lesson too:
**Telling a company to fuck all the way off feels really, really good.**  

The thing is, people must still bank with these assholes.  Which is incredible.  Every time I see them in the news I wonder how these assholes are still in business.  This [article](https://www.npr.org/2022/12/20/1144331954/wells-fargo-billions-wrongful-fees-settlement) from NPR reports Wells Fargo agreed to pay $3.7 billion dollars because they did shit things.  One of the shit things they did?  "Improper overdraft fees".  How this company is still in business is beyond me.
