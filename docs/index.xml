      <description>Once upon a time, I was very young. I got a job. That job asked me to get a bank so they could deposit their checks directly to me. Young, independent, and so very sure of myself I walked into a Wells Fargo. They opened a checking account for me, and everything was fine. The job didn&amp;rsquo;t last long. I counted every penny as every penny was precious.
So it was really weird when I checked my account and it was over drafted by $100 dollars.</description>

      <description>Like most things, this all started to see if I could.
See, I&amp;rsquo;d had this idea for The Trouble with Travis a long time ago. It would be a blog space, where I&amp;rsquo;d explore (and probably fumble a bit) through some writings and just get it out there. See where it lead. But there were several problems with how I&amp;rsquo;d set it up.
Well, not problems exactly. It was cumbersome. Wordpress was heavy for what I wanted to do.</description>
