      <description>&lt;p&gt;Like most things, this all started to see if I could.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See, I&amp;rsquo;d had this idea for The Trouble with Travis a long time ago. It would be a blog space, where I&amp;rsquo;d explore (and probably fumble a bit) through some writings and just get it out there. See where it lead. But there were several problems with how I&amp;rsquo;d set it up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, not problems exactly. It was cumbersome. Wordpress was heavy for what I wanted to do. It turns out that if you put a small barrier to entry, I&amp;rsquo;m not prone to write very much on that plat form.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
