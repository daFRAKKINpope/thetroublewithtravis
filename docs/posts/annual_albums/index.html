                <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Since 2014 I&rsquo;ve been keeping a chronicle of albums. This is typically music that I find during that year, or that was relevant to me in some way personally. This page serves as a chronicle of those albums so the songs are not lost. As a rule, album titles and songs are locked after the year&rsquo;s end.</p>
