            <div class="page-content">
                <p>Once upon a time, I was very young.  I got a job.  That job asked me to get a bank so they could deposit their checks directly to me.  Young, independent, and so very sure of myself I walked into a Wells Fargo.  They opened a checking account for me, and everything was fine.  The job didn&rsquo;t last long.  I counted every penny as every penny was precious.</p>
<p>So it was really weird when I checked my account and it was over drafted by $100 dollars.  $100 dollars I had no way to pay back.  Wells Fargo told me I had ten dollars.  That I&rsquo;d spent seven on cigarettes.  I then spent twenty dollars at something called a &rsquo;treat center&rsquo;.  Then I&rsquo;d spent two dollars for delicious beverage.  I didn&rsquo;t have enough money for the treat center, then I didn&rsquo;t have enough money for the delicious beverage, so they&rsquo;d charged me two overdraft fees for $35 buckos each.  Which means I&rsquo;d owed them $100 dollars.  That is a lot of money for a jobless 18 year. Their story has one additional problem, I never went to a treat center.</p>
<p>Now, I can already hear you.  &ldquo;Oh suuuuure. The impulsive, irresponsible, young, 18 year old DIDN&rsquo;T get treats.&rdquo;  And, I mean, yeah. Okay. That&rsquo;s fair.  I do love treats.  Even today.  But I swear to you.  I did <em>not</em> enter an establishment called the treat center, and I have never received a single treat in my entire life. So I did what any level headed, mature teenager would do.</p>
<p>I went in person to the receptionist and asked her just what in the fuck they thought they were doing. They opened a fraud case.  They said they&rsquo;d investigate the charge, and get back to me in a few weeks.  I told them to go fuck themselves and close my account.  Then I walked across the street to a credit union and have never had an issue since.</p>
<p>A few weeks later Wells Fargo sent me a letter saying they removed the charges and the late fees.  But I&rsquo;d already moved on from the relationship to my hotter, more sexy, credit union.</p>
<p>The thing is, every time I see their commercials or their banks on the side of the road I&rsquo;m filled with rage.  The implication that I recklessly went in for twenty dollars of treats when I knew I didn&rsquo;t have the money.  And then!  And then they had the audacity to charge me over SEVENTY DOLLARS for those twenty dollars of treats.  Even if I had overspent how the fuck are you going to charge me $70 dollars for not having $20?  Like, where do you think that money is going to come from?</p>
<p>It was just then that I&rsquo;d learned an important lesson:
<strong>It&rsquo;s expensive to be poor.</strong></p>
<p>I&rsquo;d learned another lesson too:
<strong>Telling a company to fuck all the way off feels really, really good.</strong></p>
<p>The thing is, people must still bank with these assholes.  Which is incredible.  Every time I see them in the news I wonder how these assholes are still in business.  This <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/12/20/1144331954/wells-fargo-billions-wrongful-fees-settlement">article</a> from NPR reports Wells Fargo agreed to pay $3.7 billion dollars because they did shit things.  One of the shit things they did?  &ldquo;Improper overdraft fees&rdquo;.  How this company is still in business is beyond me.</p>
