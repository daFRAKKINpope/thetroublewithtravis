      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since 2014 I&amp;rsquo;ve been keeping a cronical of albums. This is typically music that I find during that year, or that was relevant to me in some way personally. This page serves as a cronical of those albums so the songs are not lost. As a rule, album titles and songs are locked after the years end.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Fuck Wells Fargo</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Once upon a time, I was very young.  I got a job.  That job asked me to get a bank so they could deposit their checks directly to me.  Young, independent, and so very sure of myself I walked into a Wells Fargo.  They opened a checking account for me, and everything was fine.  The job didn&amp;rsquo;t last long.  I counted every penny as every penny was precious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it was really weird when I checked my account and it was over drafted by $100 dollars.  $100 dollars I had no way to pay back.  Wells Fargo told me I had ten dollars.  That I&amp;rsquo;d spent seven on cigarettes.  I then spent twenty dollars at something called a &amp;rsquo;treat center&amp;rsquo;.  Then I&amp;rsquo;d spent two dollars for delicious beverage.  I didn&amp;rsquo;t have enough money for the treat center, then I didn&amp;rsquo;t have enough money for the delicious beverage, so they&amp;rsquo;d charged me two overdraft fees for $35 buckos each.  Which means I&amp;rsquo;d owed them $100 dollars.  That is a lot of money for a jobless 18 year. Their story has one additional problem, I never went to a treat center.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
